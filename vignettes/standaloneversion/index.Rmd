## BAMP standalon version

BAMP is available as standalone version (version 1.3). The standalone version no longer actively developed.

## Downloads

* [BAMP Windows version](bamp.zip)
* [BAMP Linux version](bamp.tar)
* [R scripts for BAMP results](bamp.R)
* [S-Plus scripts for BAMP results](bamp.ssc)
* [dos2unix](dos2unix.zip)

### Installation/Usage Windows:  

* Unzip the downloaded bamp.zip file
* Edit the bamp.ini file and you can start the program with a doubleclick on the BAMP-icon.

If you want to use your own ini-files, you have to use a MS-DOS-console:

> bamp ini-file

Please be sure, that the file cygwin1.dll is in the same folder as bamp.exe.
    
We recommend to convert bamp.ini to unix format using [dos2unix] after editing the file with WordPad. Unpack dos2unix to the bamp folder. After editing and saving bamp.ini, drop the bamp.ini file on the dos2unix icon. After this, BAMP should run smoothly on all Windows versions.

### Installation/Usage Linux

Extract the bamp.tar file using

> tar xf bamp.tar

Edit the bamp.ini file and start the program:

> ./BAMP
       
## Manual â€“ Quick steps

Detailed information on the software, the data and the output can be found in [Schmid, Held: Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort Modeling and Prediction - BAMP, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol. 21, Issue 8, Oct 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v021.i08). 

### Quick steps

After you have installed BAMP, edit the bamp.ini file or write your own ini-file. Then start the program by typing

> bamp ini-file

or (if you use bamp.ini) just type

> bamp

On window-based OS you can also start BAMP with a double click on the BAMP-icon. BAMP then will use the bamp.ini file

### Input-Files

BAMP needs inputfiles with the population data and the number of deaths. Both files have to be matrices of number of agegroups x number of periods (or transposed, see dataorder). The data has to be seperated by blanks.

### Predictions

If you want to get predictions of future deathrates, set predictions to 1. Set number of predictions to the number of periods for which you want the predictions. If you also have population projection, set predictions to 3.
In order to test the model you can also make prediction for existing data. Then the input files must include this data, the matrices have to be of order number of agegroups x (number of periods + number of predictions). Set deviance to 2 and BAMP will calculate the deviance for the predicted periods.
